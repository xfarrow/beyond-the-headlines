# Beyond the headlines

## Abstract
Numerical analysis reveals Financial Crises may not be as devastating as thought for average investors.

We often see headlines like _"The stock market fell by X%"_ but did our own portfolios really drop by the same amount? Most average investors donâ€™t invest everything at the all-time high. While lump-sum investing is statistically the most effective approach on average, in reality, factors like regular income and gradual savings lead most people to invest on a recurring basis, more akin to dollar-cost averaging (DCA).

Our analysis focuses on extreme market conditions. We will demonstrate that:
* Investors who were in the market at least one year prior to the all-time high tend to experience significantly smaller losses.
* The time required to recover from downturns is notably shorter. In fact, risk shouldn't be viewed solely in terms of market volatility, but also in terms of time to recovery  (the duration it takes for a portfolio to return to its previous value).
